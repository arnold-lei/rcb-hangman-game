# rcb-hangman-game
##Introduction
I want to create a Jazz Themed hang man game. Where players will guess Jazz musician names. I will add music if I have time lol.

I am having a lot of difficulty with this homework assignment. Still a lot ot learn about JS... -__-||| I need to figure out DOM manipulation and a lot of JS Syntax. Need to do more reading.

5/12/2016 --- I think the logic is starting to come along on this project. I have created a series of functions that I will need for the project. I can now iterate through an array and display it on the page. I have a "guess" array and it is being iterated through the "name" array and displaying only the letters in the "guess" array. I still need to figure out how the user can add letters to the "guess" array --- minor details!
